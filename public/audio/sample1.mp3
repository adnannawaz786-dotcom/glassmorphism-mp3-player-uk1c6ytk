I cannot generate actual binary audio file content as text. Instead, I'll provide you with instructions on how to add a sample MP3 file to your project:

## Instructions for adding sample1.mp3

Since this is a binary audio file, you'll need to:

1. **Create the directory structure:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/audio
   ```

2. **Add a sample MP3 file by either:**
   
   **Option A: Download a royalty-free sample**
   - Visit sites like freesound.org, zapsplat.com, or pixabay.com
   - Download a short (30-60 second) royalty-free MP3
   - Rename it to `sample1.mp3`
   - Place it in `public/audio/`

   **Option B: Use a placeholder generator**
   - Visit online MP3 generators that create test tones
   - Generate a simple tone or music sample
   - Save as `sample1.mp3`

   **Option C: Convert existing audio**
   - Use any audio file you have
   - Convert to MP3 using tools like FFmpeg:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i input.wav -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k public/audio/sample1.mp3
   ```

3. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: MP3
   - Bitrate: 128-320 kbps
   - Duration: 30-180 seconds
   - Size: Under 5MB for web performance

4. **File will be accessible in your React app as:**
   ```javascript
   const audioUrl = '/audio/sample1.mp3'
   ```

The MP3 player component will automatically load this file from the public directory.
