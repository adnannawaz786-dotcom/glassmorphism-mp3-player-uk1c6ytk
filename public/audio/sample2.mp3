I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as it requires binary data that cannot be represented in text format. MP3 files are binary audio files that need to be created with audio encoding software or obtained from legitimate audio sources.

For your glassmorphism MP3 player project, you have a few options to add sample audio files:

## Option 1: Use Free Audio Resources
Download royalty-free MP3 files from:
- **Freesound.org** (requires free account)
- **Zapsplat.com** (free with account)
- **YouTube Audio Library** (royalty-free music)
- **Pixabay Music** (free music tracks)

## Option 2: Generate Audio Programmatically
Create a simple tone or audio file using tools like:
- **Audacity** (free audio editor)
- **Online Tone Generator** websites
- **Web Audio API** (generate tones in JavaScript)

## Option 3: Use Web Audio API for Demo
Instead of a static file, you could generate audio dynamically:

```javascript
// Example: Generate a demo tone
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(440, audioContext.currentTime); // A4 note
oscillator.connect(audioContext.destination);
```

## Recommended File Structure
Place your MP3 files in:
```
public/audio/
├── sample1.mp3
├── sample2.mp3
└── sample3.mp3
```

Once you obtain legitimate MP3 files, simply copy them to the `public/audio/` directory and they'll be accessible via `/audio/sample2.mp3` in your React application.
